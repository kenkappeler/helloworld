once upon a time there was a coding genious, though he didn't know it was so ... given any task and a few pretzels he could accomplish anything given a bit of time to focus.  But he was easily distracted if given too many tasks. He would make brilliant inroads on each new task presented, but seldom completed anything until a situation (or manager) posed a deadline.
